# AOC 2023
Attempts for AOC 2023. Code is done first in CPP for practice, and then done in Python.

## Day 1
* Learning to compile cpp programs locally using `C++ 20`
* Discoving `find()` and `rfind()` are a thing
* Familiarising myself with pointers and aliases, vectors and maps
* Identifying characters that are digits and working with characters as integers

## Day 2
* Learning to split a string by a separator in cpp

## Day 3
* Finding an efficient way to solve the problem

## Day 4
* Misunderstanding part 2 for an hour :<

## Day 5
* Learning to work with bigger numbers by using `unsigned int` and `unsigned long` to prevent overflow
* Coming up with a strategy for part 2 and deciding to reverse engineer the ranges of seeds that correspond to ranges of locations, sorted by ascending location

## Day 6
* Learning to work with even larger numbers by using `long long` and `double` to prevent overflow

## Day 7
* Deciding to try out enums in cpp for the first time to represent the hand types
